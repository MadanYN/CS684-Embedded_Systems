# CS684-Embedded_Systems
The final objective of the course project was to build a search and resuce robot which is capable of traversing a square grid and recognize the properties of each cell in the grid using the color information of each cell and finally make a map of the area traversed <br>
The whole project is divided into assignments and labs
Assigmnets
  1. Reactive Kernel - Basic cyber physical system
  2. Lustre.gz - Implementing black line following using simple PID controller implemented in Yakindu Statechart
  3. Heptagon - Implementing black line following using simplwe PID controller as finite state automata in heptagon

Labs
  1. FSM for Line Follower - Implementing line following algorithm as a finite state machine in Qfsm software
  2. Heptagon Implementation of PS - Incorporating path planning and plath traversal algorithm algorithms with the line following algorithm in heptagon
  3. Drivers - Setting up the alphabot hardware and writing firmware for TR sensor, color sensor and motor driver
  4. Line Follower on Alpha-bot - Combing the heptagon line follower with the driver firmware and finetuning the threasholds for the given map and different lighting conditions
